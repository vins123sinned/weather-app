# weather-app
A weather app utilizing the power of [Visual Crossing's](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api/) API and promises to deliver real time data about any city in the world.

The main goal of this project is to practice my newfound knowledge of promises, async/await, APIs, and even form validation using JavaScript. It also presents a great opportunities for creating dynamic JavaScript interactions, such as displaying the weather of a city once the data is fetched. All in all, this is a great small project to reinforce what I've learned before moving on to new topics.
